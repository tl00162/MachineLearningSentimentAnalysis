A project focused on financial sentiment analysis using LSTM and GRU models. The dataset consists of labeled financial statements classified as positive, negative, or neutral. The project explores strategies to reduce overfitting, including architecture simplification, regularization, dropout, and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, it experiments with GRU and Attention mechanisms for improved performance. This repository is ideal for learning about text tokenization, recurrent neural networks, and fine-tuning deep learning models for sentiment analysis.
